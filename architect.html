              <h2>Programming</h2>
              <p>
                The architect takes notes of what the owner states that they
                <br />
                want in the project. Usually, the architect provides these
                notes<br />
                in some form of typed format, possibly with photos of the<br />
                property, with some discussion of site features and<br />
                opportunities for the to-be-built items. The architect will<br />
                often include a site visit with a typed understanding of site<br />
                elements and how and where the built structures might be<br />
                located.

              <h2>Schematic Design</h2>
              <p>
                The architect uses the Program established in the previous
                phase<br />
                of work to conceptually create a diagram or plans of the<br />
                proposed project. In SFR projects, some architects may
                combine<br />
                Design Development with Schematic Design, as sometimes some<br />
                architects only make a hazy sketch, in schematics, while
                others<br />
                start out the project on computer and stay on computer, as
                they<br />
                feel that is a more efficient method and that nothing is wasted.

              <h2>Construction Documents</h2>
              <p>
                This is where the final details are added to the project.<br />
                Building sections, wall sections, finish schedules, door<br />
                schedules, title sheets, index sheets, final graphics,
                blow-up<br />
                detail plans and elevations of critical conditions, notes,
                final<br />
                detailed dimensions, interior elevations (depending on scope
                of<br />
                services and other additional services). The architect does<br />
                coordinate all the building consultants, whether provided
                under<br />
                the architectâ€™s umbrella or not. The amount of fee can and
                will<br />
                affect the amount of drawings and other items provided by the<br />
                architect.
